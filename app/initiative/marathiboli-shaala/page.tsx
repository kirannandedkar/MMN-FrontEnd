            The purpose of the MarathiBoli Marathi Shaala is to encourage
            children to speak in Marathi. Children should have the ability to
            conduct meaningful conversations in Marathi due to exposure to the
            language in the classroom and at home. In addition to speaking
            ability, this shaala also emphasizes learning the Devanagari script,
            and reading and writing short essays and letters.
